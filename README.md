This code uses the data from the Cleveland Heart Clinic to train a model that detects if a patient has a risk of heart disease. 
The model uses Logistic Regression to train the model on the patients data by engineering the the columns into new data points.
The results should aim towards more false positives than false negatives and should not be taken as final diagnosis but rather forward patients to medical professionals. 
Below is the model metrics and confusion matrix.
